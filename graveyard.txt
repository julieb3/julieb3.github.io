          <p>This was the original pitch for a logo identity for a motavational speaker. The client was drawn to bold type with distortion and the since the name was "Don't Settle" I pitched that the distortion could relate to unsettled water.
          After some expirementation I created this animation by printing the normal logo and weighing down the paper in the bottom of a bath tub. I then (carefully) set up lights and shot a video on my phone parralell to the waters surface and recorded the water being disrupted by my hand.
