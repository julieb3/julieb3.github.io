                    <p>Originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Juliette has a bachelors in design from York University and Sheridan College. For her thesis she studied cartography and wayfinding to expirement with the usability of maps for nature spaces. Wanting to help others, Juliette became a junior design researcher at University of Calgary's medical research innovation centre called W21C. With a desire to do more work related to the environment and learn more about mapping, Juliette began her masters in Cartography in Germany and Austria as part of an international joint masters programme.
                    </p>
                    <p>Her strong thirst for knowledge has led her to learn about many different streams of design. She enjoys work that is hands on and involves complex problem-solving, design research and improving the world we live in. Juliette is best described as an information & experiential designer and researcher.
