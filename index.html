                  <p>Inspired by Theo Deutinger’s ground breaking work in his book The Ultimate Atlas, I was inspired to use the space I had for this 11x 17 infographic print. I created a graph which compared the landspace of different post secondary campus' in Toronto and the percentage of greenspace within them. I wanted the graph to use up the space on the page so it could be visualized easier. I felt the calming purple and logical green would bring forth a theme of relaxation since being surrounded by nature is been proven to decrease negative thoughts and stress.</p>

                  <strong>Animation</strong>
                  <p>This was the original pitch for a logo identity for a motavational speaker. The client was drawn to bold type with distortion and the since the name was "Don't Settle" I pitched that the distortion could relate to unsettled water.
                  After some expirementation I created this animation by printing the normal logo and weighing down the paper in the bottom of a bath tub. I then (carefully) set up lights and shot a video on my phone parralell to the waters surface and recorded the water being disrupted by my hand. I then digitized it and used the frames to creat this looping animation.</p>

                <strong>3D Design</strong>
                <p>In March of 2021 I was assigned a project which originally was meant to create a complex wearable paper object. Due to the lockdown I was able to design and build these shoes from found objects in my apartment. </p>

                <strong>Information Design</strong>
                <p>Inspired by Theo Deutinger’s ground breaking work in his book The Ultimate Atlas, I was inspired to use the space I had for this 11x 17 infographic print. I created a graph which compared the landspace of different post secondary campus' in Toronto and the percentage of greenspace within them. I wanted the graph to use up the space on the page so it could be visualized easier. I felt the calming purple and logical green would bring forth a theme of relaxation since being surrounded by nature is been proven to decrease negative thoughts and stress.</p>

                <p>To create an expressive typographic poster I created a coded program in processing to create the structure and form for a print poster. Like always, I got carried away with coding and ended up with a colorful program with type in motion that was choreographed to music.</p>

                <strong>Animation</strong>
                <p>This was the original pitch for a logo identity for a motavational speaker. The client was drawn to bold type with distortion and the since the name was "Don't Settle" I pitched that the distortion could relate to unsettled water.
                After some expirementation I created this animation by printing the normal logo and weighing down the paper in the bottom of a bath tub. I then (carefully) set up lights and shot a video on my phone parralell to the waters surface and recorded the water being disrupted by my hand. I then digitized it and used the frames to creat this looping animation.</p>

                <p>The 12 images in this portfolio are pastel drawings of my high school peers in a colection titles 'Innate Youth'. I created these pieces to express the emotional, naive, and natural states teens go through as they learn to become adults.
